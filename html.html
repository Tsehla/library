<html><!-- this is how you start html file -->
<!-- following is a head head section 
     head contains a title of the page
     scripts, fonts, css and any other things
     you want to include or link so it can
     be used in you html page when loading
     -->
<!--remeber browser downloads webpages, emages, scripts,
    etc to the user computer before it can display it,
    it's like they get their on copy of your website on their 
    compueter or phone -->
    
 <head>
 <!-- head used to load stuff or do things before the webpage 
      body load, you can't do much but can get css to apply styles as the 
      body is loading, or a script check for things like location of the user
      if you want you side to be accessible in certain places 
      and stop page load if condition are not met, also use to load fonts etc -->
    <!---- the title of the webpage or website ---->
    <title>My Library </title>
    <!--tags are opend or started with " <> " brackets in html
        allways they are closed by adding forward slash in them like
        </>-->
        <!-- not all tags are close, example input tags are only opened
        <input>-->
        
        <!----attach scripts ---->
        <!--*** JavaScript is best attached in the body
            as a last thing before body closing tag " </body>" 
             this is it needs to be run after all html content 
             is loaded, because that html elements you need it to work on 
             exist, en if the script is loaded before the html body has completed
             loading, if the element it need to work was not loaded then JavaScript will
             think the element does not exist, en things will break 
             you wouldn't know what wrong cause you code is good***-->
             
             <!---lets add css --->
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
          <!-- to link resources most of time you need the link 
               tag and add some properties/attributes
               for css you need to specify " rel='stylesheet' "
               you can specify type like " type='style/css' "
               it's not needed besides above to get stuff workin -->
            <!--the take does not have ending/closing tag "</>"
                this type of tags are called self closing tags 
                there are not many of them  -->
                
                <!--- close head it's enough for us for now---->
  </head>
  <!--body this is where what user see en press takes place 
      including things that user can't see, but those are handle 
      by JavaScript, html gives the structure of the house, 
      css desides how things are placed, coloured, their size-->
      
   <!-- body start tag -->
   <body> 
   <!-- on the body tag you can have things like
   <body onload="your function">
   ____to call the function when body is loading
   ____mostly used to redirect a user to another website or web page
   <body style="myStyke">
    ___this way you running script or applying css styles 
    like you did with title and body onload would refer to a function inside the script tags in head.
    example <head>
               <title>My Title </title>
               <link rel='stylesheet' here='style/mystyle.css'>
               <script type='text/JavaScript'>
                 my function
                </script>
              </head>
    ****for css when using style='mystyle' which is only usable inside elements opening tags
     "<p style='mystyle'> " this is called inline styling. inline styling 
     affects things inside opening and closing tags, and is only applicable to items
     with opening and closing tags.
   -->
   
   
   <!-- body text came added using-->
   <h>My heading</h> <!-- for heading -->
   <h1> Still heading</h1> <!-- adding numbers help differentiate you heading not required but use
                                useful for styling when using non inline css method -->
                                
   <p>My paragraph</p> <!-- for paragraph-->
   <code>My code</code><!-- and many more -->
   <!-- you can use html styling also -->
   <p> my paragraph <b>This is bold</b></p>
   <p> my paragraph <i> This is italic</i></p>
   
   
   <!-- add script -->
   <!--to attach external script like we did with css
   JavaScript should be called after the element it need to refer on
   and css prefer to be called before also inline stylingb
   takes priority in deciding style on the same element if 
   external styling is applied on that element-->
   
   <script type="text/JavaScript" src="myscript.css"></script>
   <!-- this is how you attach external script 
   pay attention to "src" vs "href" and that the tags are not self closing-->
   <!-- adding non external JavaScript -->
   <script>
  // my scripts
  </script>
   
<!--close body -->
</body>
<!-- close html-->
</html>
